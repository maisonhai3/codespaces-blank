# Log Collector PoC - Comparison Report

**Test Date:** $(date '+%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S')
**Objective:** Compare Fluent Bit, Filebeat, Vector, and Logstash for AiScout edge deployment

## Executive Summary

This PoC tested 4 log collection tools across 3 critical scenarios:
1. **Baseline Performance** - Normal operation resource usage and throughput
2. **Offline Resilience** - Behavior during network disruptions  
3. **Backpressure Handling** - High-load performance and memory management

## Test Environment

- **Platform:** Docker Compose on Ubuntu 24.04.2 LTS
- **Log Format:** JSON (AiScout format simulation)
- **Destination:** Elasticsearch 8.11.0
- **Network:** Bridge network with simulated disruptions
- **Monitoring:** Docker stats every 5 seconds

## Individual Test Results

- [fluent-bit Results](fluent-bit-results.md) - **FAILED**
- [filebeat Results](filebeat-results.md) - **FAILED**
- [vector Results](vector-results.md) - **FAILED**
- [logstash Results](logstash-results.md) - **FAILED**

## Comparison Summary

- **Offline Capabilities:** [Based on test results]
- **Configuration Simplicity:** [Based on assessment]
- **Maintenance Overhead:** [Based on assessment]

## Recommendations

### For AiScout Edge Deployment:

**Primary Recommendation:** [To be filled based on results]

**Reasoning:**
- Performance characteristics align with edge device constraints
- Offline resilience meets requirements
- Configuration complexity manageable for operations team
- Resource usage optimized for edge deployment

**Alternative Option:** [To be filled based on results]

**Implementation Considerations:**
1. Container resource limits and monitoring
2. Log rotation and disk space management
3. Network retry and buffering configuration
